# How to setup 8086 MASM on DOSBOX


## Step 1) Download the required files
For setting up the environment download these two files:
1. The binaries for 8086 which include EDIT, MASM, LINK, DEBUG. Download it here: [8086.zip](https://github.com/Glitchyi/ssmp-lab/files/13656994/8086.zip)

#### There should be a 8086.zip file where you download it (usually in your downloads folder)
